# _fine-strucutres_
### Official SDK for _[Fine Structures](https://github.com/2x3systems/prime-materials)_, _a [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) unifying theory_

------------------------------



## Quick Start

With [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed, build the `go2x3` binary:
```bash
% make build
% cd cmd/go2x3 && ls learn
```

Explore or run any of the tutorial scripts:
```bash
% ./go2x3 learn/00-hello-electron.py
% ./go2x3 learn/01-foundations.py
% ./go2x3 learn/02-techniques.py
% ./go2x3 learn/03-standard-catalogs.py
% ./go2x3 learn/04-neutron-decay.py
% ./go2x3 learn/05-cycles-deep-dive.py
% ./go2x3 learn/06-lepton-non-universality.py
% ./go2x3 learn/07-factors-of-light.py
% ./go2x3 learn/08-catalog-inspect.py
```

Or skip the above and go directly to the [learn](https://github.com/fine-structures/sdk-go/tree/main/cmd/go2x3/learn) scripts and their "[gold](https://github.com/fine-structures/sdk-go/tree/main/cmd/go2x3/learn/gold)" output.

## Getting Started

This project is a library & demonstration toolkit for [2x3 Particle Theory](https://github.com/2x3systems/prime-materials).  Although [lib2x3](http://https://github.com/fine-structures/sdk-go/tree/main/lib2x3) is a pure Go library, [`gpython`](http://github.com/go-python/gpython) is used to embed and expose it.  This means scripting is easy  â€” see for yourself in the [first tutorial](https://github.com/fine-structures/sdk-go/blob/main/cmd/go2x3/learn/01-foundations.py) as you follow along in its [output](https://github.com/fine-structures/sdk-go/blob/main/cmd/go2x3/learn/gold/01-foundations.txt).

## Hot Topics

- Explore Traces normalization (to 0..1 non-linear transformations) 
    - Normalize each term by 1/Ci^2 or 3 and then sum (area and volume packing!)
    - Maybe the odd TracesTerms pack into open loops while even TracesTerms pack into closed loops?
    - [Hopf mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYR9worLEGo)
    - 3D volume packing of [Trapezo-Rhombic Dodecahedra](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trapezo-RhombicDodecahedron.html)
        - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezo-rhombic_dodecahedron)
        - [Cosmic evidence](https://www.cosmic-core.org/free/article-261-astronomy-the-geometry-of-galactic-clusters-part-2/)

- Consider y8d:
    - the odd cycles can only come from passing through one the two loops in this graph.

- Factor Traces into "prime basis vector" (count of each prime dot prime[i])
