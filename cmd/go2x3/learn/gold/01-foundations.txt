Our friend the proton:  p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

If we want to get the traces of a 2x3 graph, we can!
proton.Traces():  (5, 13, 35)
proton.Traces(10):  (5, 13, 35, 97, 275, 793, 2315, 6817, 20195, 60073)

Or we can access each Traces element easily thanks to python:
    T[0]: 5
    T[1]: 13
    T[2]: 35
    T[3]: 97
    T[4]: 275
    T[5]: 793
    T[6]: 2315
    T[7]: 6817
    T[8]: 20195
    T[9]: 60073

Now let's meet GraphStream, allowing us to do more useful things with particle Graph objects.
GraphStream is a chain (pipeline) of Graph operators where Graphs are "pushed" into a stream's inlet and "pulled" from its outlet. 
Adding .Print(label) prints each graph that passes though the stream, printing the given label along with a counter.
Adding .Go() terminates a stream and pulls all the graphs through it:
Hello proton!,000001,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

For each particle that AllVtxSigns() takes in, it sends out all possible permutations of loop signs:
electron.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000002,p=1,v=1," ooo    _ ","","1^",1,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000003,p=1,v=1," ooo   __ ","","1^^",-1,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000004,p=1,v=1," ooo  ___ ","","1^^^",-3,

The more loops that are present, the more permutations that are possible:
proton.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
proton.AllVtxSigns,000002,p=1,v=3," ooB  oAC  ooB   _  2    ","","1^-2-3",3,9,21,
proton.AllVtxSigns,000003,p=1,v=3," ooB  oAC  ooB  __  2    ","","1^^-2-3",1,13,7,

proton.AllVtxSigns,000015,p=1,v=3,"2ooB  oAA 2__       ","","1^^-2-3^^",-3,13,-21,

proton.AllVtxSigns,000018,p=1,v=3,"2ooB  oAA 2__   _   ","","1^^-2^-3^^",-5,13,-35,

For particles containing only 'gamma' vertices, only one permutation is possible:
gamma.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,

All edge permutations for a two-vertex photon:
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000001,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000002,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2  _ ","","1--~2",0,2,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000003,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2 __ ","","1-~~2",0,2,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2___ ","","1~~~2",0,18,

For each particle that AllEdgeSigns() takes in, it sends out all possible permutations of positive and negative edges:
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000001,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000002,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA    _         _ ","","1~2-3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000003,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA    _         _ ","","1-2~3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000004,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA   __ 2  _ ","","1~2~3",5,13,35,

Most graphs can be expressed identically in multiple ways.
Consider various equivalent ways to label a neutron:
neutron[a]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","1-2-3-1-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[b]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","1-2-3-1 2-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[c]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","3-4 2-3-1-2",4,14,34,98,

EnumPureParticles() runs an algorithm that generates all possible valid particles having only loops and positive edges.
This algorithm is mechanical and will therefore repeat equivalent particles having different labels. 
Let's generate from v=1 to v=3:
out[7],000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
out[7],000002,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
out[7],000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
out[7],000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
out[7],000005,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
out[7],000006,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
out[7],000007,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,

out[7],000014,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2 1=3",3,15,27,
out[7],000015,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1=2 1-3",3,15,27,
out[7],000016,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2-3=1",1,13,19,
out[7],000017,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1=2-3-1",1,13,19,

The DropDupes() operator only emits unique graphs while dropping duplicates.
out[8],000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
out[8],000002,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
out[8],000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
out[8],000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
out[8],000005,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,
out[8],000006,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1-2=3",3,15,27,
out[8],000007,p=1,v=3,"3oOO 3    ","","1-2-3-1",3,9,27,
out[8],000008,p=1,v=3,"2OOB  oAA 3    ","","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,

We can select by matching Traces:
out[9],000001,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,

We can also select by min and max vertex count:
out[10],000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
out[10],000002,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,

out[10],000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,

We can select by + or - loops:
out[11],000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
out[11],000002,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,

out[11],000009,p=1,v=3," BBC  oAA  ooA 3    ","","1=2 1-3",3,15,27,

We can select by + or - loops:
