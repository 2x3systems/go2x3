Our friend the proton:  p=1,v=3,"3ABB 3+++ "," u|| 2|uu 3+++ ","1-2-3",5,13,35,

If we want to get the traces of a 2x3 graph, we can!
proton.Traces():  (5, 13, 35)
proton.Traces(10):  (5, 13, 35, 97, 275, 793, 2315, 6817, 20195, 60073)

Or we can access each Traces element easily thanks to python:
    T[0]: 5
    T[1]: 13
    T[2]: 35
    T[3]: 97
    T[4]: 275
    T[5]: 793
    T[6]: 2315
    T[7]: 6817
    T[8]: 20195
    T[9]: 60073

Now let's meet GraphStream, allowing us to do more useful things with particle Graph objects.
GraphStream is a chain (pipeline) of Graph operators where Graphs are "pushed" into a stream's inlet and "pulled" from its outlet. 
Adding .Print(label) prints each graph that passes though the stream, printing the given label along with a counter.
Adding .Go() terminates a stream and pulls all the graphs through it:
Hello proton!,000001,p=1,v=3,"3ABB 3+++ "," u|| 2|uu 3+++ ","1-2-3",5,13,35,

For each particle that AllVtxSigns() takes in, it sends out all possible permutations of loop signs:
electron.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=1," AAA  +++ "," uuu  +++ ","1",3,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000002,p=1,v=1," AAA  ++- "," uuv  ++- ","1^",1,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000003,p=1,v=1," AAA  +-- "," uvv  +-- ","1^^",-1,
electron.AllVtxSigns,000004,p=1,v=1," AAA  --- "," vvv  --- ","1^^^",-3,

The more loops that are present, the more permutations that are possible:
proton.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=3,"3ABB 3+++ "," u|| 2|uu 3+++ ","1-2-3",5,13,35,

proton.AllVtxSigns,000018,p=1,v=3,"3AAB 2--+  ++- ","2vv|  ||v 2--+  ++- ","1^^-2^-3^^",-5,13,-35,

For particles containing only 'gamma' vertices, only one permutation is possible:
gamma.AllVtxSigns,000001,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2+++ ","2UUU 2+++ ","1---2",0,18,

All edge permutations for a two-vertex photon:
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000001,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2+++ ","2UUU 2+++ ","1---2",0,18,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000002,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2++- ","2UUV 2++- ","1--~2",0,2,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000003,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2+-- ","2UVV 2+-- ","1-~~2",0,2,
gamma.AllEdgeSigns,000004,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2--- ","2VVV 2--- ","1~~~2",0,18,

For each particle that AllEdgeSigns() takes in, it sends out all possible permutations of positive and negative edges:
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000001,p=1,v=3,"3ABB 3+++ "," u|| 2|uu 3+++ ","1-2-3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000002,p=1,v=3,"3ABB  ++-  +++  -++ "," u||  |uu  |uu  ++-  +++  -++ ","1~2-3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000003,p=1,v=3,"3ABB  ++-  +++  -++ "," u||  |uu  |uu  ++-  +++  -++ ","1-2~3",5,13,35,
proton.AllEdgeSigns,000004,p=1,v=3,"3ABB  +-- 2-++ "," u|| 2|uu  +-- 2-++ ","1~2~3",5,13,35,

Most graphs can be expressed identically in multiple ways.
Consider various equivalent ways to label a neutron:
neutron[a]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2ABB  ACC 4+++ "," ||| 2|Uu  |uu 4+++ ","1-2-3-1-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[b]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2ABB  ACC 4+++ "," ||| 2|Uu  |uu 4+++ ","1-2-3-1 2-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[c]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2ABB  ACC 4+++ "," ||| 2|Uu  |uu 4+++ ","3-4 2-3-1-2",4,14,34,98,

EnumPureParticles() runs an algorithm that generates all possible valid particles having only loops and positive edges.
This algorithm is mechanical and will therefore repeat equivalent particles having different labels. 
Let's generate from v=1 to v=3:
out[7],000001,p=1,v=1," AAA  +++ "," uuu  +++ ","1",3,
out[7],000002,p=1,v=2,"2AAA 2+++ ","2Uuu 2+++ ","1-2",4,10,

The DropDupes() operator only emits unique graphs while dropping duplicates.

out[8],000008,p=1,v=3,"3AAB 3+++ ","2UU|  ||u 3+++ ","1-2=3-1",1,13,19,
